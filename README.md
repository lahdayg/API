# API
# What is an API? (Application Programming Interface)

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.

# How Does A REST REQUEST WORK

Before diving into API testing, you’ll need to learn a few of the basics. An API is made up of a set of REST requests. These are the requests made to an application server that retrieve, delete, or manipulate data in an application’s database

A REST request is made up of the following parts:

An HTTP verb that describes what action should be taken

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that defines the location of the request

HTTP headers that provide information to the server about the request

A request body that provides further details for the request (this can sometimes be empty)

Here are the most common HTTP verbs:

A GET request fetches a record from a database

A POST request adds a new record to a database

A PUT request replaces a record with a new one

A PATCH request replaces part of a record with new information

A DELETE request removes a record from a database
